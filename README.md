## 🏛️ Project Architecture

The project follows a modern, modular data engineering workflow, separating concerns for maintainability and scalability.

1. **Extract:** Raw data files (JSON, CSV) are ingested from their source locations.
2. **Transform:** A series of robust Python scripts, organized by function, systematically clean, standardize, de-duplicate, and validate the data using the **Pandas** library.
3. **Load:** The cleaned and validated data is loaded into a normalized **SQLite** database, with a clear schema, foreign keys, and indexes for query performance.
4. **Analyze & Visualize:**
  * The primary analytics layer is an interactive **Streamlit** web application (`app.py`) that queries the clean database.
  * A bonus module uses the **Google Gemini AI** to automate the mapping of new, unknown data schemas.

## 📊 Interactive Dashboard Demo

The final output of the pipeline is an interactive Streamlit dashboard designed for business analysts. It provides at-a-glance KPIs and real-time visualizations to track performance and explore the unified dataset.

## 🎯 Key Challenges & Solutions

This project successfully tackled numerous real-world data quality issues.

| Category | Challenge | Solution Implemented |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🔀 **Structural Chaos** | **Extreme Column Redundancy:** Fields like `cust_id`/`customer_id` and `order_status`/`status` existed for the same concept. | Implemented a **coalescing strategy** using `.fillna()` to merge data into a single, canonical column before dropping the redundant ones. |
| 🔢 **Data Type Issues** | **Inconsistent Data Types:** Numbers stored as text, dates in multiple formats, and booleans represented as strings (`'yes'`), integers (`1`), and booleans (`True`). | Created robust cleaning functions using `pd.to_datetime(errors='coerce')` and `pd.to_numeric` to standardize all data into proper `datetime`, `int`, `float`, and `boolean` types. |
| ✍️ **Formatting Errors** | **Inconsistent Categorical Data:** City names (`NYC`, `new_york`), states (`CA`, `California`), and statuses (`ACTIVE`, `pending`) lacked a standard format. | Used a combination of string methods (`.lower()`, `.title()`) and explicit mapping dictionaries to standardize all categorical data. |
| 🔗 **Relational Integrity** | **Orphan Records:** Orders existed that referenced `customer_id`s or `product_id`s not present in the master tables. | Implemented a **validation step** before the final load to cross-reference foreign keys, ensuring that only orders with valid customer and product references were loaded into the database. |

## 🤖 AI-Powered Schema Reconciliation (Bonus)

A key feature of this project is the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) to automate a traditionally manual data engineering task.

**Problem:** How do you efficiently ingest data from a new source when its column names don't match your database schema?

**Solution:**
1.  **Prompt Engineering:** A detailed prompt was crafted to instruct the Google Gemini AI to act as a "data mapping assistant."
2.  **API Integration:** The script sends the target schema and the new source columns to the Gemini API.
3.  **Automated Transformation:** The AI returns a structured JSON mapping. This JSON is programmatically used to automatically rename the columns of the new DataFrame, preparing it for the cleaning and loading process.

This demonstrates a powerful, scalable approach to reducing development time and onboarding new data sources with minimal friction.
